When deploying on render please make sure to make the root folder as "./server",
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: node index.js

Also don't forget to copy the environment variables.

**IMPORTANT**: Since our URL is static(For the time being), when you deploy from your render application,
you might get a URL simillar to this: https://lost-and-found-project-1-8iqn.onrender.com, and the data will not appear.
But our code runs on this URL https://lost-and-found-project.onrender.com/ where everything is working perfectly.

Thank you for your time and attention.
